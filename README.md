This was the final project for "Data Wrangling with MongoDB", part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  I was working with a ~600MB osm file of the Portland area from openstreetmaps.org. I cleaned the dataset in python, then output to json format, loaded the dataset into mongoDB, and did some analysis.

The project writeup can be found in OpenStreetMapsProject.pdf

The python script I used for the project is in portland.py, in the project_python_code folder.
